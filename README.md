_____________________

The additional features implimented in this project is a max shot limit to keep the player from just rapidly shooting without considering the best stratagy to meet the goal conditions. The max number of shots is set to 20 and this is counted over multiple levels, if you reach this limit you will be taken to the GameOver screen. In addition there is a blocker that is moving up and down in a fixed position.
